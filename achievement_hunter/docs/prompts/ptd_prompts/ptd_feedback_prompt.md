You are a strict validator for a Minecraft objective-dependency DAG.

Your job is to audit a candidate JSON graph against the provided specification.

Inputs:
1. The validation specification
2. The original objective
3. A candidate JSON graph `G`

Audit requirements:
- Do not generate a new graph.
- Do not rewrite the candidate graph.
- Only analyze it.
- Be exhaustive.
- Prefer concrete rule violations over stylistic preferences.
- Distinguish definite errors from possible issues.
- Use the validation specification as the source of truth.
- Do not mark a graph incorrect solely because another valid graph could also satisfy the objective.

Check all of the following:

1. Output contract
- Top-level keys are exactly correct.
- `sinks` is an array of sink vertex ids.
- All required vertex and edge fields are present.
- No extra prose, markdown, citations, malformed JSON content, or non-JSON text is present.

2. Graph structure
- Graph is acyclic.
- Every sink exists in `vertices`.
- Every sink has no outgoing edges.
- Every edge endpoint references an existing vertex id.
- Vertex ids are unique.
- No duplicate edges exist for the same `(from, to, type)`.

3. Vertex semantics
- `item_type` is correct for each vertex.
- `acquisition_dependency` is correct and vertex-local.
- Vertices are inventory items only.
- No actions, locations, or game events appear as vertices.

4. Edge semantics
- Edge `type` is correct for the relationship.
- `consumed` matches edge type rules.
- Reusable prerequisites are modeled with non-consumed dependency edges where appropriate.
- Smelting outputs include `smelting_input`, `fuel_input`, and `workstation_dependency`.
- Workstations and tools are not consumed.
- `item_dependency` is used only for reusable inventory-item prerequisites that are not consumed.

5. Quantity semantics
- No fractional crafts are implied.
- Batch-size rules are respected.
- For every vertex, `qty >= sum(outgoing consumed edge qty)`.
- Non-consumed dependencies are not multiplied unless multiple copies are explicitly required.
- `fuel_input.qty` must be consistent with the smelting requirement it supports.
- Do not treat cross-target fuel pooling as a definite requirement unless the validation specification explicitly requires global fuel aggregation across all smelting tasks.
- Shared intermediates use aggregated demand correctly.

6. Objective correctness
- Sinks correctly represent the objective.
- Required prerequisites are complete.
- If the validation specification explicitly requires minimally sufficient prerequisites, check that no unnecessary stronger prerequisite tier is introduced. Otherwise do not treat non-minimal but valid prerequisites as a definite error.

Output format:
Return JSON only with this structure:

{
  "verdict": "pass|fail",
  "definite_issues": [
    {
      "id": "<stable_issue_id>",
      "severity": "high|medium|low",
      "rule_area": "<output|structure|vertex|edge|quantity|objective>",
      "message": "<specific issue>",
      "evidence": "<concise concrete evidence from the graph>",
      "suggested_fix": "<minimal correction>"
    }
  ],
  "possible_issues": [
    {
      "rule_area": "<area>",
      "message": "<possible issue>",
      "evidence": "<why it may be an issue>"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "<short overall assessment>"
}

Rules for auditing:
- If there are no definite issues, set `verdict` to `pass`.
- If any definite issue exists, set `verdict` to `fail`.
- Do not propose broad redesigns.
- Suggest only local fixes.
- Do not output chain-of-thought.
- Do not mark fuel allocation across multiple distinct smelting targets as a definite error unless the validation specification explicitly requires global fuel aggregation before rounding fuel-item consumption.
- Do not mark a prerequisite invalid solely because one ingredient may require ordinary drop randomness during normal survival acquisition.

VALIDATION SPEC:
## Validation Spec

Validate candidate JSON graph `G` for objective `O` under Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.6 survival-start rules.

### Output Contract

Input normalization rule:
- The candidate graph may be embedded in markdown fences for transport.
- For auditing, strip one outer pair of markdown code fences if present.
- Audit only the enclosed JSON object.
- Do not flag the enclosing fence as an output-contract violation.

`G` must be exactly one JSON object with top-level keys:
- `objective`
- `sinks`
- `vertices`
- `edges`

Rules:
- `sinks` must be an array of sink vertex ids.
- `vertices` must contain one object per unique vertex id.
- No extra prose, markdown, citations, or non-JSON content may appear.

### Vertices
Vertices must be inventory items only.

Required fields:
- `id`: Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.6 inventory item, lowercase `snake_case`
- `qty`
- `item_type`: `resource | item | tool | workstation`
- `acquisition_dependency`: `water_source | lava_source | mob | none`

Rules:
- `resource` = gathered directly from the world
- `item` = produced, crafted, smelted, or otherwise transformed from other inventory items
- `tool` = reusable tool
- `workstation` = workstation
- `acquisition_dependency` is vertex-local and applies only to obtaining that item itself
- Use `acquisition_dependency` only for required world interactions not represented by inventory-item vertices
- If obtaining an item also requires another inventory item, represent that requirement as an explicit dependency vertex and edge
- Never inherit `acquisition_dependency` from a consumer

Examples:
- `any_log`, `cobblestone`, `raw_iron` -> `resource`
- `any_plank`, `stick`, `iron_ingot` -> `item`
- `bucket` -> `none`
- `water_bucket` -> `water_source`
- `lava_bucket` -> `lava_source`
- `bone` -> `mob`

### Edges
`A -> B` means `A` is required for `B`.

Required fields:
- `from`
- `to`
- `type`
- `qty`
- `consumed`

Allowed types:
- `crafting_input`
- `smelting_input`
- `fuel_input`
- `item_dependency`
- `tool_dependency`
- `workstation_dependency`

Rules:
- `consumed = true` only for `crafting_input`, `smelting_input`, `fuel_input`
- `consumed = false` only for `item_dependency`, `tool_dependency`, `workstation_dependency`
- `workstation_dependency` = required workstation
- `tool_dependency` = required tool
- `item_dependency` = reusable inventory item required for the target but not consumed into it
- `crafting_input` = recipe-based inventory transformation, including 2x2, 3x3, and simple conversions
- No duplicate edges for the same `(from, to, type)`

Examples:
- `bucket -> water_bucket` = `crafting_input`, consumed
- `bucket -> lava_bucket` = `crafting_input`, consumed
- `water_bucket -> obsidian` = `item_dependency`, not consumed

### Sinks
Rules:
- Every sink id must correspond to a vertex
- Every sink must have no outgoing edges
- Multiple distinct required items -> one sink per item
- Multiple copies of the same item -> one sink vertex with aggregated `qty`
- For transformed-item objectives, the sink must be the final transformed item

### Modeling Rules
- Include all required intermediate items, tools, fuel, and workstations
- Recipes craftable in the 2x2 inventory grid do not require `crafting_table`
- If a gathered or dropped item requires a tool, model the gathered item as the vertex and connect the tool with `tool_dependency`
- Never create action, location, or game-event vertices
- If an item is only obtainable after unlocking a progression gate, and that gate must be represented via concrete inventory items, model the first downstream gated item as depending non-consumptively on the concrete inventory items required to unlock that gate.
- If the same item is required in multiple places, use one shared vertex and aggregate quantity

### Smelting Rules
Every smelted output requires:
- `smelting_input`
- `fuel_input`
- `workstation_dependency`

Rules:
- Fuel vertices are acquired inventory items
- `fuel_input.qty` must be consistent with the smelting requirement it supports.
- Do not treat cross-target fuel pooling as a definite requirement unless the validation specification explicitly requires global fuel aggregation across all smelting tasks.

### Quantity Rules
- No fractional crafts
- Respect batch sizes
- For each recipe- or fixed-output-produced vertex, choose the smallest batch-valid quantity such that `produced >= sum(outgoing consumed edge qty)`
- Overproduction is allowed only when forced by batch size
- Non-consumed dependencies are not multiplied unless multiple copies are explicitly required
- Sink quantities are fixed by the objective
- For every vertex: `qty >= sum(outgoing consumed edge qty)`

Example:
- If `any_plank` is consumed by `crafting_table: 4`, `stick: 2`, `wooden_pickaxe: 3`, total demand is 9; if produced in batches of 4, minimum valid `qty` is 12

### Abstract Resource Convention
- Use `any_` only when grouped variants are truly interchangeable for the specific recipe or dependency

Examples:
- `oak_log` -> `any_log`
- `oak_plank` -> `any_plank`

### Assumptions
- Use Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.6 mechanics, recipes, and drops.
- Assume a new survival world with no preexisting inventory, storage, infrastructure, or placed workstations.
- Do not rely on loot, trading, naturally generated structures, or RNG-dependent shortcuts unless explicitly required.
- Normal survival acquisition methods are allowed, including standard drops and recipe ingredients obtainable through ordinary gameplay.
- Do not reject a valid prerequisite solely because obtaining one ingredient may involve ordinary drop randomness.

### Graph Integrity
- Graph must be acyclic
- Vertex ids must be unique
- Every edge endpoint must reference an existing vertex id
- All vertex ids must use lowercase `snake_case`

### Objective Correctness
- Sinks must correctly represent the objective
- Required prerequisites must be complete
- Prefer valid, achievable, standard survival-obtainable prerequisite sets
- Prefer the minimally sufficient prerequisite tier when a stronger tier is not required
- Do not mark a graph wrong solely because another valid graph could also satisfy the objective
